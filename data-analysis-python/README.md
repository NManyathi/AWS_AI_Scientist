# 📘 Data Analysis with Python — Exercises, and Mini-Projects

This repository contains my learning progress and practice work for the **Data Analysis** section of the **AWS AI Scientist Scholarship (Udacity)**.  
It covers **Python data analysis fundamentals** using Jupyter, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.  
All code, datasets, and analysis examples here are my own work — created independently to strengthen my understanding of each concept. Only the **Pandas lesson** references data provided through Udacity coursework; all other exercises and projects are fully self-developed.

## 🧠 Lessons Overview

### 1️⃣ Jupyter Notebooks (Setup)
**Objective:**  
Set up and use Jupyter Notebooks as an interactive environment for running Python code.

**Key Topics:**
- Installing Jupyter and configuring virtual environments  
- Running and saving notebooks (`.ipynb` files)  
- Combining code, text, and visuals using Markdown  
- Inline plotting and documentation best practices  

> 🧩 *All lessons below (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib & Seaborn) are developed and run within Jupyter.*

---

### 2️⃣ NumPy
**Objective:**  
Understand and use NumPy for efficient numerical computation and array manipulation.

**Key Topics:**
- Arrays, vectors, and matrices  
- Broadcasting and slicing  
- Element-wise operations  
- Random number generation and statistical functions  

**Exercises:**  
- Create and manipulate arrays  
- Compute mean, median, and standard deviation  
- Compare list vs array performance  

**Mini-Project:**  
📊 *“Statistical Summary Calculator”* — build a tool to compute descriptive statistics using NumPy arrays.
📊 *Array Operations and Insights* – small practice project demonstrating array-based analysis.


---

### 3️⃣ Pandas
**Objective:**  
Work with structured data using Pandas for cleaning, transformation, and statistical analysis.

**Key Topics:**
- Series and DataFrames  
- Importing and exporting data (CSV, Excel)  
- Handling missing values  
- Filtering, grouping, and merging datasets  
- Data summarization and correlation  

**Exercises:**  
- Load, clean, and analyze tabular datasets  
- Apply custom and lambda functions  
- Explore real-world data using descriptive statistics  

**Mini-Project:**  
📈 *“Statistics From Stock Data”* — apply NumPy and Pandas to analyze stock price trends.  
Tasks include loading CSV data, computing daily returns and moving averages, and visualizing trends with Matplotlib and Seaborn.

---

### 4️⃣ Matplotlib and Seaborn — Part 1
**Objective:**  
Visualize data using Matplotlib and Seaborn to identify trends and insights.

**Key Topics:**
- Basic plots (line, bar, histogram, scatter)  
- Customizing axes, titles, and legends  
- Plot aesthetics with color palettes and styles  

**Exercises:**  
- Create different chart types using both libraries  
- Customize visuals with annotations and labels  

**Mini-Project:**  
📉 *“COVID-19 Data Trends”* — visualize infection rates, recoveries, and regional comparisons using real-world data.

---

### 5️⃣ Matplotlib and Seaborn — Part 2
**Objective:**  
Advance your visualization skills with multi-plot layouts, statistical visualizations, and presentation-ready graphics.

**Key Topics:**
- Subplots and figure grids  
- Heatmaps, pairplots, and boxplots  
- Theming and fine-tuning visual presentation  

**Exercises:**  
- Create multi-panel dashboards  
- Explore relationships using Seaborn’s statistical plots  

**Mini-Project:**  
📊 *“Sales Performance Dashboard”* — build a visual analytics dashboard showing key sales and revenue metrics.
📊 *Data Visualization Dashboard* – combines Matplotlib and Seaborn to produce clean, informative visuals.

## 🚀 How to Run

# Follow these steps to set up and explore the notebooks in this project:

1. **Activate your virtual environment (recommended for isolation):**
   ```bash
   # Windows
   path\to\venv\Scripts\activate

   # macOS/Linux
   source path/to/venv/bin/activate

2. **Navigate to this project folder:**
   cd data-analysis-python


3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
   jupyter notebook


4. Open any exercises or mini-project notebook and run the cells sequentially to explore the analysis and visualizations.

> 💡 Tip: If you want Jupyter to always use this environment, register it once using:
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=<your_env_name> --display-name "Python (<your_env_name>)"

---

## 🧾 Notes
- Developed using **Python 3.x** and **Jupyter Notebook**.  
- Core libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`.  
- All exercises and mini-projects demonstrate end-to-end data analysis workflow — from data loading and transformation to visualization and interpretation.  

> 💬 All projects and exercises (except the Pandas lesson) are based on my own work — from selecting datasets to defining project goals and analysis steps.  
> The Pandas mini-project uses Udacity-provided data and guidance as part of the structured lesson content.
