# 📊 Pandas Practice & Mini Projects

This directory focuses on hands-on **Pandas exercises and mini-projects** completed as part of my data analysis learning journey.  
The tasks are designed to build a strong foundation in data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis using Python’s Pandas library.

---

## 🧩 Structure Overview

| Category | Description | Files |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| **Exercises (Completed)** | Guided exercises following Udacity-provided instructions (`TODOs` and comments). | `manipulate_dataframe.ipynb`, `manipulate_series.ipynb` |
| **Mini Project (Completed)** | Stock Data Statistics project provided by Udacity for analysis and visualization practice. | `mini_project-statistics-stockdata.ipynb`, `GOOG.csv`, `AMZN.csv`, `AAPL.csv` |
| **Planned Personal Project** | My upcoming independent analysis project using open-source data. | `mini-project-employee-salary-insights.ipynb` (to be created) |

---

## 🎯 Purpose

All shared projects and exercises in this folder are **for educational purposes** — they reflect my practical understanding of Pandas, data wrangling, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).  
Projects provided by **Udacity** are strictly for **learning and testing knowledge**, while my upcoming personal project will demonstrate how I apply these skills to real-world, open datasets.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Activate your Python virtual environment (if you use one):**
   ```bash
   # Windows
   path\to\env\Scripts\activate

   # macOS/Linux
   source path/to/env/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Pandas folder:**
   ```bash
   cd path/to/pandas
   ```

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Open any notebook and run the cells sequentially to explore the analysis.

> 💡 *Tip:* If Jupyter doesn’t detect your environment, register it once using:
> ```bash
> python -m ipykernel install --user --name=your_env_name --display-name "Python (your_env_name)"
> ```
> Then select **Python (your_env_name)** as the kernel inside Jupyter.

## ⚙️ Upcoming Personal Project

### **mini-project_employee-salary-insights.ipynb**
- Objective: Analyze an open-source salary dataset to uncover **trends, averages, and outliers**.  
- Focus Areas: Data cleaning, aggregation, visualization, and statistical exploration.  
- Data Source: Will be publicly available and properly cited in the notebook.
