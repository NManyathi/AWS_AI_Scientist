# NumPy

**Objective:**  
Learn and practice NumPy for efficient numerical computation and array manipulation.

**Key Topics:**  
- Arrays, vectors, and matrices  
- Broadcasting and slicing  
- Element-wise operations  
- Random number generation and statistical functions  

**Exercises:**  
- Create and manipulate arrays  
- Compute mean, median, and standard deviation  
- Compare performance: Python lists vs NumPy arrays  

**Mini-Project:**  
ðŸ“Š **Statistical Summary Calculator** â€” a small tool to compute descriptive statistics using NumPy arrays.  
  - **Files included:**  
    1. `mini-project_statistical_summary-calculator.ipynb` â€” Notebook demonstrating how to read numeric data and compute descriptive statistics step by step.  
    2. `summary_functions.py` â€” Python script containing reusable NumPy-based functions for mean, median, variance, standard deviation, min, max, and percentiles.  
    3. `sample_data.csv` â€” Sample dataset with 150 numeric records used to test the notebook and functions.  
  - **Description:** This mini-project allows you to explore key statistical measures, compare results, and learn how to handle numeric datasets efficiently with NumPy.  

ðŸ“Š *Array Operations and Insights* â€“ small practice project demonstrating array-based analysis.
