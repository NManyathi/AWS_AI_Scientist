# NumPy

**Objective:**  
Learn and practice NumPy for efficient numerical computation and array manipulation.

**Key Topics:**  
- Arrays, vectors, and matrices  
- Broadcasting and slicing  
- Element-wise operations  
- Random number generation and statistical functions  

**Exercises:**  
- Create and manipulate arrays  
- Compute mean, median, and standard deviation  
- Compare performance: Python lists vs NumPy arrays  

**Mini-Project:**  
ðŸ“Š **Statistical Summary Calculator** â€” a small tool to compute descriptive statistics using NumPy arrays.

> **Note:** Generated `.npy` files (e.g., saved arrays) are for local use only and should not be committed, especially if large.
