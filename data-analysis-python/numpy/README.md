## 🎯 Purpose

All shared projects and exercises in this folder are **for educational purposes** — reflecting my practical understanding of NumPy and numerical computation.  

- Exercises provide a **strong foundation** in arrays, slicing, broadcasting, and basic statistics.  
- Mini-projects demonstrate **real-world application** of array operations and statistical analysis.  
- Together, these notebooks showcase both **technical execution** and **analytical reasoning**.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Activate your Python virtual environment (if applicable):**
   ```bash
   # Windows
   path\to\env\Scripts\activate

   # macOS/Linux
   source path/to/env/bin/activate
Navigate to the NumPy folder:

cd path/to/numpy
Launch Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook
Open any notebook and run the cells sequentially to explore exercises or mini-projects.

💡 Tip: If Jupyter doesn’t detect your environment, register it once using:

python -m ipykernel install --user --name=your_env_name --display-name "Python (your_env_name)"
Then select Python (your_env_name) as the kernel inside Jupyter.
