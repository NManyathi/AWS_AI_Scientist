# PROFESSIONAL COMMENT:
# This script was designed as part of an AI-powered image classification project.
# It demonstrates the ability to design, structure, and implement functions that
# process results, generate statistics, and highlight misclassifications.
# The work reflects best practices in software development, data analysis,
# and clear reporting â€” key skills for professional environments and freelance
# opportunities.c

# OBJECTIVE:
# The purpose of this file is to define a single function `print_results`.
# The function prints:
#   1. A clear summary of classification results.
#   2. Key statistics (counts and percentages).
#   3. Misclassifications, when requested.
# The design ensures the results are both technically useful for debugging
# and accessible for reporting to non-technical stakeholders.
#
# Printing Results

    FUNCTION OBJECTIVE:
    Print summary results on the image classification task, including
    optional reporting of misclassified dogs and misclassified breeds.

    PARAMETERS:
      results_dic (dict) - Key = image filename, Value = List:
           [0] Pet Image Label (string)
           [1] Classifier Label (string)
           [2] 1/0 -> Labels match? (1 = match, 0 = no match)
           [3] 1/0 -> Pet Image is-a-dog? (1 = yes, 0 = no)
           [4] 1/0 -> Classifier says is-a-dog? (1 = yes, 0 = no)

      results_stats_dic (dict) - Key = statistic name, Value = value
           Example keys: 'n_images', 'n_dogs_img', 'pct_correct_dogs'

      model (str) - CNN architecture used (e.g., 'resnet', 'alexnet', 'vgg')

      print_incorrect_dogs (bool, default=False) -
           If True, prints images incorrectly classified as dogs/not-dogs.

      print_incorrect_breed (bool, default=False) -
           If True, prints images incorrectly classified by breed.

    RETURNS:
      None - This function prints outputs directly.
