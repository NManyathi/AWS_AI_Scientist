# 🐶 Dog Breed Classifier  

This project uses **a pre-trained deep learning model** to classify images as **dogs vs. not dogs**, and if the image is a dog, it further identifies the **specific dog breed**. It is part of Udacity’s *AI Programming with Python Nanodegree*.

---

## 📌 Project Overview  

The objective is to:
1. **Load and preprocess image data.**  
2. **Use transfer learning** with a pre-trained CNN (Convolutional Neural Network).  
3. **Classify images** into two categories: *dogs* and *not-dogs*.  
4. **For dog images**, predict the **correct breed**.  
5. **Compare the performance** of three different CNN architectures:
   - VGG  
   - ResNet  
   - AlexNet

## ⚙️ How It Works  

1. **Dataset Preparation**  
   - Place all training images inside the `data/pet_images/` folder (at least 40).  
   - The file names are used as the “ground truth” labels. Example:  
     - `Golden_retriever_1.jpg` → *Golden Retriever*.  

2. **Choose a Model Architecture**  
   The program supports:  
   - `vgg`  
   - `resnet`  
   - `alexnet`  

3. **Run the Program**  
   Run the classifier with a specific architecture:  

   ```bash
   python check_images.py --dir data/pet_images/ --arch vgg --dogfile dognames.txt
   ```

   Or run all models using the batch script:  

   ```bash
   ./run_models_batch.sh
   ```

4. **View Results**  
   Results include:  
   - Total images processed  
   - % correct dogs  
   - % correct breeds  
   - % correct “not-dog” classification  
   - Overall accuracy

pct_correct_notdogs : 95.00
```

### AlexNet  
```
*** Percentage Statistics ***
pct_match           : 75.50
pct_correct_dogs    : 85.00
pct_correct_breed   : 78.00

## ✅ Key Findings  

- All three models can distinguish dogs from not-dogs reliably.  
- **VGG** showed the **highest accuracy in breed classification**.  
- **ResNet** also performed strongly but slightly lower.  
- **AlexNet** had the lowest performance, which is expected given it’s an older architecture.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  

- **Python 3.8+**  
- **PyTorch** (pre-trained models)  
- **NumPy & PIL** for data handling  
- **Shell scripting** for automation
